## INTRODUCTION
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common heart disease seen in today’s population worldwide. Recent studies of the American Heart Association have shown that coronary artery diseases recorded 13% death in the USA in 2018 and worldwide in 2015. Amongst other diseases CAD found to be one of the most common causes of death, with the record of 15.6% of all results across the globe. Because this disease is associated with modifiable risk factors which indirectly related with lifestyle and intervention, timing of detection and diagnostic accuracy are especially relevant in clinical management of patients with CAD.
Over the past years, approaches making a significant impact in the detection and diagnosis of diseases that include machine learning (ML). In general, ‘training’ an algorithm with a control dataset for which the disease status (disease or no disease) is known, and then applying this trained algorithm to a variable dataset in order to predict the disease status in patients for whom it is not yet determined. The ML algorithm will be better trained as a predictor for disease status as larger cohorts of data are introduced. prediction with ML would empower clinicians with improved detection, diagnosis, classification, risk stratification and ultimately, management of patients, all while potentially minimizing required clinical intervention are More accurate.
